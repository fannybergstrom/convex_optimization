# Convex Optimization

This repository contains solutions to theoretical excersises and programming assignments to the PhD course "Data-driven statistical modelling with optimisation" given by Tobias Ryd√©n in spring 2020.

Most of the excersises come from "Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generelizations" by Hastie, Tibshirani and Wainwright ( https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/StatLearnSparsity/).
